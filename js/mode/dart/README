A codemirror mode for dart, designed against Codemirror-2.18 (and updated to 
work against 2.3.0).

The relative paths in this mode expect it to exist in a typical codemirror
source tree, which is to say:

codemirror/
  css/
  lib/
  mode/ <--- HERE
  theme/
  ...

Tests can be found in the tests/ dir.
